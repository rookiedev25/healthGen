## ðŸ§  Logic and Mechanism (JS Code)

The JavaScript in this project includes:

- **Input Validation:** Checks all fields for empty or suspicious inputs. Flags inappropriate entries with red borders and shake animation.
- **Custom Textarea Behavior:** The optional `textarea` for additional requests includes a character limit (100 words), mimicking Twitter-like feedback.
- **Plan Generator Logic:** A lightweight health algorithm selects diet/exercise recommendations based on:
  - Selected health goal
  - Chosen activity level
  - Optional additional info (used for fine-tuning responses)
- **Dynamic UI Feedback:** Shows error messages until correct input is entered. Messages automatically disappear once the user fixes their mistake or moves to another field.
